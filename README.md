### Just a bunch of Design Patterns Implemented in C++
#### Motivation
I have been reading about Software Architectures and Design Patterns for long. Many of us might find them unnecessary at times but they do really make code better. For example, having a Strategy Pattern is way better than writing so many switch and if-else-if. They provide very good layer of abstraction. Design Patterns make code reusable. And yes, I agree, they are unnecessary at times so we can skip them whn not required strongly.
The most beneficial advantage of these design patterns is Communication. Instead of explaining this, that and then that should happen in software, someone can just explain the requirement and label a design pattern. 
#### What this repo has
Exactly what the title says. I will be adding more patterns as I get time, may be in some other language as well. As of now, patterns are divided into four categories.
<ol>
	<li>Creational Patterns</li>
	<li>Structural Patterns</li>
	<li>Behavioural Patterns</li>
	<li>Concurrency Patterns</li>
</ol>
There is a short introduction of scenario in each example file. For more information, refere Wikipedia page of Software Design Patterns.
A complete list of patterns in this repository is as follows.
<ol>
	<li>Creational Patterns</li>
